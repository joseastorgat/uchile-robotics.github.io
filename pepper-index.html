                    <p>Pepper is a humanoid robot developed by SoftBank robotics focused in human-robot interaction.  The Robocup@home committee choose Pepper as one of the platforms
                        for the Standard Platform League.</p>

                    <p>Pepper's abilities include the identification of emotions in humans; based in the voice tone and facial gestures, speech recognition and synthesis and sound localization.  Additionally, Pepper has all the hardware needed to implement computer vision, navigation through dynamic environments and manipulation of objects.  With this range of skills Pepper can be a great assistant in home-like environments.</p>

                    <p>The UChile Peppers team is working in implementing all of those skills in the robot Pepper looking to participate in the 2017 version of Robocup.</p>
